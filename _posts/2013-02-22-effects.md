# Canvace effects
It is possible to "animate" the stage by enabling some special effects. Effects must be first instantiated and configured, and then
added to the stage renderer.

{% highlight javascript %}
var renderer = renderLoop.getRenderer();
var effect = new Canvace.RumbleEffect(100);
renderer.addEffect(effect);
{% endhighlight %}
    
This is an example usage. The stage renderer object is taken from the RenderLoop initialized at the beginning of the game. Note that as soon as the effect is
added to the renderer, it takes place at the next rendering iteration. Canvace provides two effects.

### Rumble effect
This effects shakes the viewport, simulating rumbling. In the Canvace.RumbleEffect constructor you can set up the duration of the shaking, expressed in frames, and some
additional options controlling the direction and the amplitude of the shaking effect.

### Debug effect
This effect is useful for debugging the game during the development. It may be configured to superimpose a variety of information to the game stage. Among those:
- entities' bounding boxes (only valid for entities with physics enabled);
- entities' velocity, uniform velocity, and acceleration vectors, again only when the physics is enabled;
- solid map (not sure how to explain).

The debug effect doesn't have a fixed duration: once added to the renderer, it is displayed for the entire "life" of the game stage.
