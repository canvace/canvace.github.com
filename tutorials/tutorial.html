<h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

<p>Canvace is a platform designed to help developers creating browser games based on HTML5 canvas. It is composed of two parts: a development environment, where the game appearance and main components are set up, and a Javascript API.</p>

<p>The intended workflow when developing with Canvace is outlined here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the development environment is used to set up the game graphics (maps, characters, &#8230;): in Canvace;</li>

<li>the stages (levels) composing the game are saved and exported in a standard representation;</li>

<li>An HTML5 file, containing the canvas which is going to house the game, is created;</li>

<li>The Javascript API is now employed to assist in the development of the game logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, a demonstrative isometric game has been developed with Canvace. The document you&#8217;re going to read will replay all the steps necessary to complete this game, guiding you through the whole process. The complete source code for the game can be downloaded HERE.</p>
