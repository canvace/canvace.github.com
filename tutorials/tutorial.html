<h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

<p>Canvace is a platform designed to help developers creating HTML5-based browser games. It is composed of two parts: a development environment, where the game appearance and graphical components are set up, and a Javascript API.</p>

<p>The intended workflow when developing with Canvace is outlined here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the development environment is used to set up the game graphics (maps, characters, &#8230;);</li>

<li>the stages (levels) composing the game are saved and exported in a standard representation;</li>

<li>An HTML5 file, containing a canvas which is going to house the game, is created;</li>

<li>The Javascript API is now employed to assist in the development of the game logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial aims at providing a straightforward but complete introduction to the most important features introduced by Canvace. For better fulfilling this task, a demonstrative isometric game has been developed with Canvace: the chapters you&#8217;re going to read will replay all the steps necessary for its creation, guiding you through the whole development process.</p>

<p>The complete source code for the game can be downloaded HERE.</p>

<h2 id='installing_canvace'>Installing Canvace</h2>

<p>Canvace requires Node.js: you can download it <a href='http://nodejs.org/download/'>here</a>. Then, Canvace is easily installed running</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install -g canvace</code></pre>

<p>from the command line. Canvace is now ready to use: the development environment is started by executing <code>canvace</code>. On Windows, if <code>canvace</code> cannot be found it may be necessary to run <code>canvace.cmd</code> instead.</p>

<p>The most recent version of the client library is available at <a href='http://www.canvace.com/download'>this link</a>. Download it in the path you&#8217;re going to develop the game into, and then import canvace.js in your game files as an external Javascript script.</p>
