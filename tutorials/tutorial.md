# Introduction
Canvace is a platform designed to help developers creating browser games based on HTML5 canvas.
It is composed of two parts: a development environment, where the game appearance and main components are set up, and a Javascript API.

The intended workflow when developing with Canvace is outlined here:
- the development environment is used to set up the game graphics (maps, characters, ...): in Canvace;
- the stages (levels) composing the game are saved and exported in a standard representation;
- An HTML5 file, containing the canvas which is going to house the game, is created;
- The Javascript API is now employed to assist in the development of the game logic.

For the purposes of this tutorial, a demonstrative isometric game has been developed with Canvace.
The document you're going to read will replay all the steps necessary to complete this game, guiding you through the whole process.
The complete source code for the game can be downloaded HERE.
